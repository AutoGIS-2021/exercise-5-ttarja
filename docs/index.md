## Publishing the maps 

In order to access the files via the links, you need to set the repository as public and adjust the GitHub pages settins
## My maps

Edit the text below and add links to the maps that you have created:

## Residents per building
Residents per building shows the population divided by the number of residential buildings in each grid cell.
Population and building grid data provided by Helsinki Region Environmental Services HSY.

## Travel times to the closest shopping center
Closest shopping center was calculated based on travel time by public transport in rush hour (exercise 4).
Markers on the map show the locations of the shopping centers. Tooltips tell the name and the address of each shopping center.
The default choropleth layer shows travel time to the closest shopping center by public transport.
The optional choropleth layers show the difference in travel time between public transport and car, and public transport and walking.
